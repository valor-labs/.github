# Welcome to the Valor Labs 👋🥷💻
Here at [Valor Software](https://valor-software.com/) we love to experiment.  Sometimes those experiements turn into something awesome, sometimes they are just a fun project that we learned from.  Our Valor Labs organization is a place for those experiments ⚗️.  Somewhere seperate from our main [Valor Software organization](https://github.com/valor-software) where our production work lives.  Our team consists of professionals and experts from all walks of life and aspects of the [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle).
